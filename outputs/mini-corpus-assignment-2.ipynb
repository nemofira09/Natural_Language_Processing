    "documents [\"Digital privacy has evolved as new technologies have disrupted the so-called information societies. It’s crucial to understand it to respect the rights of your users and keep their personal information safe from cybercrime or unauthorized use. Having a confidentiality strategy increases the trust of your customers and workers, as respecting their privacy affects the dignity and freedom of individuals. Aware of its extraordinary relevance, we want to share with you the importance of digital privacy. Still, we also want to address its advantages and disadvantages to help you understand the implications and challenges arising in using the internet and digital environments. Digital privacy is a right that seeks to guarantee the protection of the personal data of users who access a service through the internet. It must ensure that they can know, decide and control the treatment that will be made of their personal data collected on a website, application, or social network. In this way, it must be ensured that the personal data of a person or company that uses those means are not accessible to other users without prior authorization or consent to consult, download, and/or use them. In the search for the security of personal data, differential privacy is becoming increasingly relevant. At this point, and as we have been discussing along these lines, having a strategy that ensures digital privacy in your company is necessary. In that sense, process automation can become a great ally to help you avoid human errors in handling these delicate data or possible security breaches. To achieve this, you can automate audit reports and regulatory requests or use automated identity controls to manage access to your platforms, personnel selection processes, or training, creating secure and respectful environments thanks to a remote supervision system or proctoring, for example. At Smowltech, we have developed a series of flexible and scalable proctoring products that also provide parameterizable reports of your digital processes, effectively and simply complying with the GDPR. Request a free demo to share specialized solutions with you and ensure that your procedures’ privacy does not become a source of concern but rather an added value.\"\n",
    "          ,\"Digital privacy is often used in contexts that promote advocacy on behalf of individual and consumer privacy rights in e-services and is typically used in opposition to the business practices of many e-marketers, businesses, and companies to collect and use such information and data. Digital privacy can be defined under three sub-related categories: information privacy, communication privacy, and individual privacy. Digital privacy has increasingly become a topic of interest as information and data shared over the social web have continued to become more and more commodified; social media users are now considered unpaid digital labors, as one pays for free e-services through the loss of their privacy. For example, between 2005 and 2011, the change in levels of disclosure for different profile items on Facebook shows that, over the years, people have wanted to keep more information private. Observing the seven-year span, Facebook gained a profit of $100 billion through the collection and sharing of their users' data with third-party advertisers. The more a user shares on social networks, the more privacy is lost. All of the information and data one shares is connected to clusters of similar information. As the user continues to share their productive expression, it gets matched with the respective cluster, and their speech and expression are no longer only in the possession of them or of their social circle. This can be seen as a consequence of building social capital. As people create new and diverse ties on social networks, data becomes linked. This decrease in privacy continues until bundling appears (when the ties become strong and the network more homogeneous). Some laws allow filing a case against a breach of digital privacy. In 2007, for instance, a class-action lawsuit was lodged on behalf of all Facebook users that led Facebook to close its advertising system, Beacon. In a similar case in 2010, the users sued Facebook once again for sharing personal user information with advertisers through their gaming application. Laws are based on consumers' consent and assume that the consumers are already empowered to know their own best interests. Therefore, for the past few years, people have been focusing on self-management of digital privacy through rational and educated decision-making.\"\n",
    "          ,\"Digital privacy is often defined as the level of privacy an individual has regarding their personal information online and in the digital world. When talking about digital privacy in the context of an organization’s cyber security, it’s all about what organizations must do to protect users’ personal and sensitive data in all virtual contexts and situations. The concept of digital privacy centers on the fact that professional or personal affairs of collecting information may leave digital footprints. For instance, many users don’t realize that data relating to their identities and internet habits are consistently being monitored, stored, and managed To avoid the misuse of users' personal information and ensure maximum security, certain global data regulation compliances for digital privacy must be met by organizations collecting, storing, processing, and managing users' details online. For instance, data protection and privacy regulations, including the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), are already becoming more stringent. They demand businesses operating in their region comply with their respective data privacy policies. Failing to abide by these regulations may lead to hefty fines, and customers may also lose trust in the brand. Digital privacy protects all the information that exists in digital form and is created or shared while using the internet through any device, including mobile phones and PCs. These types of data include: It’s crucial for businesses that collect user information to secure their customers’ personal information. This can be done, for example, by incorporating robust and compliant security mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication and encryption, both of which add layers to the security of data. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) ensures user/customer information isn’t accessed by unauthorized individuals, even if one line of defense (passwords) is compromised. With MFA, users receive a one-time password, typically via email/ SMS text message or push notifications, that they need to enter to authenticate.There’s also the angle of using passwordless authentication, which helps mitigate the risks associated with password breaches and account takeovers resulting from phishing scams and other credential-based attacks. Businesses operating in different parts of the world couldn’t deny that meeting all the data privacy and security compliances is the toughest nut to crack. And things become quite challenging in an era when data localization is swiftly becoming the first condition to operate in a country, state, or region. However, digital privacy has more to offer besides the security and privacy advantages; it navigates overall business success. According to a consumer data protection and privacy survey conducted by McKinsey, half of the respondents agreed that they are most likely to trust a business/organization that asks for only information relevant to its products/services. Also, the brands that requested a limited amount of personal information were considered more reliable. These specific markers signal to consumers that an organization is concerned about the privacy of its customers and taking a thoughtful data management approach. And the same survey also revealed that half of the consumer respondents trust companies that quickly respond to breaches and hacks or disclose such incidents to the public. These practices are crucial for companies since the impact of data/privacy breaches may hamper overall business performance. In a nutshell, leading brands are now learning that data privacy and protection can create business advantages. So far, we’ve learned that businesses that don’t prioritize privacy investments lag behind their competitors and are likely to miss opportunities of building customer loyalty and trust. Reinventing your organization’s digital privacy policy could do wonders for your brand as it renders returns and helps demonstrate robust accountability and governance to employees, clients, and stakeholders.\"\n",

    "          ,\"Protecting privacy is the right thing to do – and a smart business decisionDigital privacy, data security, PII, GDPR…. there’s a lot of talk about privacy these days, but what does it all mean? Who’s really responsible for protecting it? And is “online privacy” even possible in a digital world? In today’s expanding threat landscape organizations face more privacy risks than ever before. It’s no longer a personal matter—the privacy of employees and customers directly affects organizations too. We’ve broken down the basics to get you up to speed on what digital privacy is, why you should care, and what you can do to protect it. Digital privacy—also called online privacy or Internet privacy—refers to the protection of private citizens’ online information. Let’s break it down…What is privacy? It helps to first understand privacy in general. Merriam-Webster defines privacy as, “a: the quality or state of being apart from company or observation, b: freedom from unauthorized intrusion”. If you sing in the shower or dance around in your kitchen while making your morning coffee you can do so uninhibited because you have privacy. What does privacy mean in the digital age? In the virtual world where every action we take can be tracked, however, privacy may seem more like an ideal concept than a reality. Your search history, the posts you ‘like’ on social media, and every keystroke you make on a digital device—you may expect this information to be private, but too often it is not. Our online activity leaves a digital “footprint” that can be used to identify us, such as social media posts, employment records, shopping and entertainment preferences, geolocation data, and financial and healthcare information. And the typical digital footprint is massive—one analysis of data from more than 20,000 users revealed that the average user has 90 online accounts, and in the US., there’s an average of 130 accounts linked to a single email address. In the digital age of working from home and BYO-Devices, there’s little distinction between personal and professional when it comes to data. This new paradigm means organizations must protect the privacy of customers and employees to protect themselves. What are the threats to digital privacy? The Internet is a dangerous place. There are two main threats to digital privacy: Data breaches and personal data availability. Data breaches expose personal data every dayData breaches are an everyday occurrence; the Verizon 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report provides analysis from nearly 4,000 breaches. These incidents can be giant, like the Equifax breach that exposed the personal data of more than one-half of the US. population. Or they can be much smaller, like the breach of a Vermont chocolatier that exposed the personal data of 90 customers. No matter the size, each and every breach puts affected individuals at risk for identity theft and privacy compromises. Data breaches fuel cyberattacks — for consumers and organizationsCyber-criminals exploit personal data for profit. Trillions of usernames, passwords, personal information, and confidential documents are for sale on all levels of the Internet—surface, deep, and dark webs. Criminals purchase and use this data to steal a person’s identity or money, commit crimes in their name, and even launch phishing or social engineering attacks on their employer. Personal data is easily tracked, stored, aggregated sold, and stolen Another threat to digital privacy is how giant companies like Facebook gather personal data. In addition to the information shared on personal pages, the company tracks everything a user Likes and Shares, the Facebook groups we belong to, events we attend, and location information from photos we post. Now that Facebook owns WhatsApp and Instagram, they can track us through those apps as well. Big data aggregates personal dataWhere it gets really creepy is when data is aggregated across multiple sites. Data brokers piece together personal information bit by bit to compile highly detailed personal profiles on millions of people — then sell the whole profile to anyone who wants it. (More on how you can remove these profiles later.)Even when data is anonymized, advertisers can target consumers based on highly detailed attributes that might seem private: such as religion, gambling habits, or even the likelihood to become pregnant!Personal data privacy risks erode consumer confidence Social media companies will argue that they don’t sell data directly—they only use it to match us with advertisers—and if we’re going to get online advertising anyway, it might as well be relevant. There are two problems with that argument. First, data that’s stored can be lost or stolen. The second issue is that bad actors are now using legitimate online advertising channels to accomplish their scams. Both fuel rising consumer privacy concerns, with a whopping 81% of consumers now saying they must trust an organization to do business with it.\"\n",
    "          ,\"Digital privacy is a hot topic as the widespread use of the internet has resulted in an increased risk of online identity theft, hacking, and data breaches. Data privacy laws such as the GDPR also mandate that companies take digital privacy seriously by clearly defining their privacy policies and how they store data. This post will define digital privacy, and talk about how to protect and safeguard your digital privacy. If you’re looking for digital privacy examples instead, we cover that in our recent post detailing 5 digital privacy examples. Digital Privacy DefinitionDigital privacy is the ability of an individual to control and protect the access and use of their personal information as and when they access the internet. Digital privacy helps individuals stay anonymous online by safeguarding personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, and credit card details. How Can We Protect Digital Privacy? Digital privacy can be protected through various measures, such as using strong passwords, encrypting data, and being cautious about sharing personal information online. However, individuals also rely on laws and regulations to protect their privacy rights online. Many countries have laws governing data protection and privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which provides individuals with the right to access, correct, and erase their personal data held by organizations. This means it is also incumbent on organizations to make sure that they’re handling data properly and informing users of how they collect, manage, store, and process data. What is Digital Privacy and Safety? Digital privacy and safety refer to the protection of individuals' personal information and security while using digital devices, technologies, and the internet. Digital privacy refers to the ability to control access to personal information, while digital safety refers to the measures taken to ensure the security of digital devices and data. Digital privacy involves protecting personal information such as name, address, email, financial information, and other sensitive data from unauthorized access or use. Measures to protect digital privacy include using strong passwords, avoiding public Wi-Fi networks, avoiding clicking on suspicious links or attachments, and limiting the amount of personal information shared online. Digital safety involves protecting digital devices and data from cyber attacks, viruses, malware, and other online threats. Measures to ensure digital safety include using antivirus software, regularly updating software and applications, and avoiding downloading software from untrustworthy sources.\"\n",
    "          ,\"The concept of digital privacy can best be described as the protection of the information of private citizens who use digital mediums. However, when people speak about digital privacy, they often are referring to it in terms of its relation to Internet usage. Despite it being a popular and often incendiary issue, the obstacle of defining what digital privacy really is can prevent resolution. Digital privacy centers on the fact that using digital mediums to conduct affairs, whether personal or professional, can leave digital footprints. For example, many Internet users don't realize that information about them and their Internet usage habits are constantly being logged and stored. A computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address can be traced back to a specific user and, as such, his website viewing habits can be monitored. Information such as the date and time of his searches, what browser he used to access websites and even how long he viewed websites can be retained on a search engine's servers. Servers can vary in the length of time they store this information before deleting it. Digital privacy can also extend to the use of domain names. Many domain owners take extra steps to protect their information by employing domain privacy services, but the success of such a maneuver is questionable. For example, some companies that specialize in domain privacy need only to receive a phone call requesting domain owner information before supplying it. Also, if a website owner forgoes using domain privacy services, his name, address, email address, telephone number and other associated details are entered into a public WHOIS database and can be recalled by anyone searching for it. Certain websites that specialize in aggregating information from various sources to provide users with profiles of private citizens also are a cause for concern among digital privacy advocates. These websites might return full names, birth dates, addresses, aliases, pictures of and maps to queried people's homes and much more. In addition, these websites can detail an individuals' history. It's not uncommon to come across information detailing the past 10 years of a queried person's life. Though digital privacy is an issue that remains at the forefront of many private citizens' thoughts as they attempt to navigate the Internet and embrace new technology, official and complete protection remains just out of reach. This is because the idea of privacy in a technological — and, thus, ever-evolving — landscape continues to change meaning. Before the issue can be addressed, there has to be a clear definition of what privacy means in the digital world. The debate over digital privacy rages on and will continue as long as technology advances. Internet users will always stand by their right to privacy and also their right to publicly accessible information. Questions about legislation continue to arise as lawmakers attempt to strike a balance between protecting its citizens' privacy and keeping them informed.\"\n",
    "          ,\"Digital privacy, also known as internet privacy, is the concept of passing information, data, messages, and files over the internet without leaking to undesired individuals. It is the control of information about yourself or your business. This concept is achieved through a set of strategies and technologies to protect private information and communication from leaking to the public. Digital privacy is basically the protection of information on the internet. It is the practice of using the internet privately without leaking or compromising information. It applies in various contexts, from data to messages and private communications. With the digital privacy definition, it’s necessary to explore the categories of digital privacy, its importance, and how individuals and organizations can keep their information private.\"\n",
    "          ,\"Data from Financial Transactions Take a moment to visualize what's involved in a simple online credit card transaction. You probably signed into the merchant's website using your email address as an account identifier and a (hopefully) unique password. After browsing a few pages, you'll add one or more more items to the site's virtual shopping cart. When you've got everything you need, you'll begin the checkout process, entering shipping information, including a street address and your phone number. You might also enter the account number of the loyalty card the merchant sent you and a coupon code you received in an email marketing message. Of course, the key step involves entering your payment information which, for a credit card, will probably include the card owner's name and address, and the card's number, expiry date, and a security code. Assuming the merchant infrastructure is compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) protocols for handling financial information, then it's relatively unlikely that this information will be stolen and sold by criminals. But either way, it will still exist within the merchant's own database. To flesh all this out a bit, understand that using your loyalty card account and coupon code can communicate a lot of information about your shopping and lifestyle preferences, along with records of some of your previous activities. Your site account comes with contact information and your home location. All of that information can, at least in theory, be stitched together to create a robust profile of you as a consumer and citizen. It's for these reasons that I personally prefer using third-party e-commerce payment systems like PayPal because such transactions leave no record of my specific payment method and on the merchant's own databases.\"]\n",
